        <p>About a month ago, my manager told me that he has come up with some ideas on how to improve our product by reducing the downtime during a product upgrade (I’m not going to talk about how to do that though :P).</p>
<p>To be honest, I actually have thought about the same idea a long time ago, because our product’s upgrade right has been very painful - it requires a manual unintall accompanied by a full backup taken long time, and then a install of the product in new version and restore of the backup. The process is so time-consuming and painful that we internally have created some scripts to automate this workflow.</p>
<p>I clearly remember I thought of how to improve the upgrade process, but that idea was somehow lost, until my manager brought it up again. When I heard it, it turned out to be such a moment that must have happened to everybody in this industry - “hey! I had the same idea before! I just didn’t do anything to make it happen!”.</p>
<p>I myself am definitely not a guy who is short of motivation. On the contrary, I regard myself as a highly motivated engineer with lots of curiosity and ambition to make things better. One example is that I realized how bad and slow our build and deploy systems were, and have proactively contributed lots of my time to improving them. Before, our systems could only build all Java projects, and I made it able to build every single one; Before, our systems could only deploy all code in serial (yes, all frontend + all backend in serial), and I made it able to deploy not only every server component individually but also all components in parallel (I also made it able to deploy all Java code in parallel!).</p>
<p>So, the question would be - how could a highly motivated guy thought of something big but ended up doing nothing and forgetting his ideas? I believe I really need to do some introspect on this, since my career goal in the foreseeable future is to become a dev manager, and I really need to bring up some big ideas to my team and company to prove myself.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>I summarized three execuses and came up with some solutions and suggestions to overcome each of them in the future:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some problems are not in the area which you are most familiar with, and you will get scared of digging deeper to find out more details and solutions.</p>
<p> I don’t usually work with a product installer and an upgrade scenario, so I have to admit I had some fear when estimating efforts required to improve it. We have all run into this situation that, if the issue locates outside your comfort zone and knowledge map, and if you think the required work is way too much or the total amount of work seems hard to estimate, you may just drop your ideas even though they may be brilliant. This is part of our human nature that makes sure we have a good ROI.</p>
<p> I have two suggestions for myself to beat the laziness monster in my body: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>First, learn more and get to know your product more, so the problem can be within your knowledge map, and thus you will have confidence to deal with it</code>. </li>
<li><code>Second, be proactive and try to conduct an initial investigation into it, quantify the workload, and then decide to proceed with it or not based on the quantified results.</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The problem you thought of is not painful enough to push you make improvments on it.</p>
<p> The build system is actually not in my knowledge map, but I ended up learning it and made improvements on it. Why is that? It’s because I had to use the older defected build and deploy systems so frequently that I cannot bear with it. The pain has turned into a force that pushed me to overcome the fearness in my mind, and pushed me to fix the out-dated systems.</p>
<p> My suggestion for myself on this one is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Try to measure the impact of a problem which may not even be your business</code>! If you can help solve a problem that has been bothering many other people (it means this problem has a HUGE impact), go ahead and fix it because it will be a great opportunity to advance your career! </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Front-line engineers may focus too much on the works in their hands, and lose the whole strategic picture. </p>
<p> As one of the front-line engineer, I have strong feelings that many times I spend too much time on finishing <code>the work assigned to me</code> - thinking about fancy design patterns and every implementation details. I’m not saying that kind of focus is no good. I’m saying <code>only having that kind of focus is not very helpful</code>.</p>
<p> Engineers with bigger ambitions should spare time to raise heads and look around, to find different views, different directions to tackle problems, different levels of understanding our company strategies and our products. This is especially useful if you want to become a dev manager or a tech lead, because such roles require not only advanced individual programming skills, but also a good sense of overall situations. </p>
<p> I have one suggestion for myself on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself more time to think bigger picture, rather than only the puzzle given to you. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all my thoughts on this particular case. Happy learning!</p>
